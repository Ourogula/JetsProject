## Jets Program

## Description
This program allows a user to manipulate an array list of jets. The manipulation is done through a menu that has options from 1 - 10, and each option has a different action.

The starting data for the array list is a local text file that is hard coded into the program, although this could be easily changed to take in a custom filename if needed. This file provides 5 starter jets to fill up the array list in the Airfield class, and the rest of the program manipulates this Airfield in some manner.

## Lessons Learned
This program was all about utilizing abstract classes, subclasses, and interfaces. The experience just from working with these different object types was quite rewarding, and it provided a much needed hands-on approach to familiarizing myself with these object types and data structures. 

The key lesson learned from this program was how to allocate an action to a certain class, and then the ability to understand why one class handles that action instead of another. The use of interfaces and abstract classes really shoehorned in my methods to their correct classes, and it allowed me to easily know the requirements and scope of each class.

All in all, the biggest lesson learned from this program was how to take 9 different files and make them work together to form a functioning program.
